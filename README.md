# Employee-Management-System

Hello and welcome to my attempt at an Employee Management system(EMS). This is a class project, I found this
homework to be quite challenging. I plan to tighten it up a little more in the future. Enjoy the sweet smoothness of the arrow and enter feedback as you surf the waves of mental labor volunteers. Cheers!

## Installation

To install this program make sure to copy the repository in the upper right corner of my repository page.
Once you hit clone paste it into the terminal on your device and download the file. 

Make sure your requirements are all up to date.
Now the program will be ready to run.

## Usage 

To use the EMS, open your terminal and run [npm start].

Now you will have a list of labeled options. Choose and option from the list via the arrow keys and hit enter when you find a selection you want. Follow the prompts in the terminal to navigate further. To exit the EMS simply navigate to the exit and hit enter, then you should return to your terminal home.
